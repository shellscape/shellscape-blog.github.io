Brew is an open source library of interface components for ASP.NET which utilizes [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com). If Brew looks familiar, that's for good reason. Brew is a heavily refactored fork of the Juice UI project. 

## Lovely, so what's it do?

Say you're an ASP.NET developer but you're not a javascript guru and you'd really like to use all of the great-looking UI widgets that jQuery UI has to offer - Brew can help. Pop a server tag onto the page and you have yourself a functional, good-looking datepicker.

</script>

And the result!

## What makes Brew different

Creating a project that's just a copy of another would be silly. Brew stands out in a few ways from it's cousin.

* Brew uses an unobtrusive, but speedy means to render widgets. That means no more huge blocks of javascript in the rendered page, and Brew doesn't litter your tags with extra attributes.
* Brew's unobtrusive javascript runs quickly and is far less complex.
* Brew's extenders and controls are simpler and more intuitive to use. 
* Brew's codebase is much smaller, making it easier to maintain and fix bugs faster.
* Brew is a spartan release, no extra fluff or unnecessary extras.
* Brew contains all of the as-yet unreleased bug fixes from the JuiceUI master repository.

## Ready to give it a try?

Have a look at the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/shellscape/brew/wiki) on the Brew wiki, visit [http://shellscape.org/#brew](http://shellscape.org/#brew) for important links, or skip all that mumbo-jumbo and go directly to the [NuGet download](http://nuget.org/packages/brew).

At the moment Brew supports only Webforms-based website projects, but that'll change in the coming weeks with full support of MVC4. Brew requires the .NET Framework v4.5 and unfortunately there are no plans to support older versions of the framework. Sorry Sharepoint users.

For bugs and unexpected problems using Brew, please file a new issue here on Github.
